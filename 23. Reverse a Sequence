;; Write a function which reverses a sequence - WITHOUT reverse or rseq.

(= (__ [1 2 3 4 5]) [5 4 3 2 1])
(= (__ (sorted-set 5 7 2 7)) '(7 5 2))
(= (__ [[1 2][3 4][5 6]]) [[5 6][3 4][1 2]])

;; Lists add from the front, so use reduce and conjugate to rebuild it backwards.

(fn [z] (reduce (fn [x y] (conj x y)) '() z))

;; Too hard! Just use "into"
into () 

;; Alt forms for testing.
(defn my-reverse [z] (reduce (fn [x y] (conj x y)) '() z))  ;; Too hard
(defn my-reverse [z] (into () z))  ;; Simpler
