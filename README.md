# 4clojure
My solutions to Clojure problems on the 4clojure.com website.

Most are unremarkable as this was my approach to learning Clojure. I've included a number of other solutions for review and comparison, and was pleased to find that frequently my solutions were similar to others I consider "experts".

My best solution is probably the Levenshtein Distance (101), which passes the tests very quickly and is probably a unique approach as it measures similarity without tracking characters. My reasoning is that the requirement does not say that the characters must be found, only that the distance (similarity) be measured. You can easily write another routine to find the characters if the similarity is above a desired threshold.
