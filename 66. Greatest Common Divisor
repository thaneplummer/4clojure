;; Given two integers, write a function which returns the greatest common divisor.

(= (__ 2 4) 2)
(= (__ 10 5) 5)
(= (__ 5 7) 1)
(= (__ 1023 858) 33)

;; Answer
;; The code to find factors for a number. Not optimized, but simple.
(defn factor [n] (filter #(zero? (rem n %)) (range 1 (inc n))))

;; Extend to get the common factors for both numbers, and return the max.
(defn factors [m n] (apply max (filter #(and (zero? (rem m %)) (zero? (rem n %))) (range 1 (inc n)))))
