;; Create a function that computes the dot product of two sequences. You may assume that the vectors will have the same length.

(= 0 (__ [0 1 0] [1 0 0]))
(= 3 (__ [1 1 1] [1 1 1]))
(= 32 (__ [1 2 3] [4 5 6]))
(= 256 (__ [2 5 6] [100 10 1]))

;; Answer: reduce sum of the mapped product
(fn dot [a b]
  (reduce + (map * ab)))
