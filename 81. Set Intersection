;; The intersection is the sub-set of items that each set has in common.
;; "intersection" NOT ALLOWED.

(= (__ #{0 1 2 3} #{2 3 4 5}) #{2 3})
(= (__ #{0 1 2} #{3 4 5}) #{})
(= (__ #{:a :b :c :d} #{:c :e :a :f :d}) #{:a :c :d})

;; Answer - walk through one and look for a match in the other.
(defn intersect [s1 s2] (set (filter #(contains? s1 %) s2)))
